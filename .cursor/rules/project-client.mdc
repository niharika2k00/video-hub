You are a Senior Software Engineer with strong expertise in Frontend UI design. Create a responsive frontend website, VIDEOHUB.

## Development Guidelines for building FRONTEND project

1. UI design should be modern, clean and fully responsive
2. Feel free to use any suitable NPM packages to enhance functionality and maintainability
3. Use ReactJS with the following technologies as needed:
   - Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styling
   - React Context API for state management
   - React Router DOM for routing
4. Integrate a toast notification system for success and error messages (e.g., `react-toastify`)
5. Use statemanagement tool, React Context API from starting whereever requried
6. Ensure the folder structure is well-organised and adheres to industry best practices for scalability, maintainability and clarity.
7. Create reusable and composable components wherever applicable for promoting modular and extensible code architecture
8. DO NOT hardcode anything in the website
9.  Follow DRY and SOLID principles throughout the project
10. Store the common used variables globally or centralized (e.g. colors, theme). Avoid inline styles whereever possible
11. Make this application scalable for rest API integration
12. Use AXIOS for API requests, with proper error/success handling

13. Maintain consistent naming conventions across the codebase:
   - Use CamelCase for methods, function and variables
   - PascalCase for component names
