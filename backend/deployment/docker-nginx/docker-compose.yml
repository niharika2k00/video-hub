      - "8080:80" # HTTP  → container:80
      - "8443:443" # HTTPS → container:443 (or "443:443" if you prefer)
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway" # needed on Linux so the container can reach your host’s :5173
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf # ro: read only can read the file but cannot overwrite or delete it

# NOTE: 443 won't work as no SSL certificate is configured in NGINX
# Host port 8080 (can be anything) is mapped to container port 80 for NGINX, so accessing http://localhost:8080, will be redirected to http://localhost:80
